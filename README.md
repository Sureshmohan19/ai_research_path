# ai-research-path

Collection of code, notes, and small experiments from my ongoing journey into AI and machine learning research.

## Overview

This repository serves as a personal workspace where I implement architectures, reproduce papers, and explore core ideas across AI, ML, and deep learning. It is not meant to be a polished library but rather a living archive of my progress and learning.

## What You'll Find

* Implementations of models and architectures I'm studying
* Small research experiments
* Explorations of RL, transformers, optimization, and more
* Notes, scripts, and prototypes

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to document my growth as I move deeper into AI research. Everything here is written to understand concepts from first principles and build intuition through code.

## Status

Active and evolving. New experiments are added as I study new topics.
